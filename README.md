This repository contains all files developed locally which contributed to the project. 
These are:
1.noise.py: adds gaussian noise
2.lowres.py: downsamples the images to a lower resolution
3.filecount.py: A function mainly used for validating the images once they had gone through various forms of processing.
4. foldersplit.py: The function used to split the original dataset into the splits used for the project.

There are additional folders with their own README files, but in summary they are the files required for the github action, automating the workflow of the datapreprocessing.
